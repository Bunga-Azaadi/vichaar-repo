## What is a Stan?

As per Azadism, a “Stan” refers to any area under the jurisdiction of a constitution or contract of sorts. Modern day examples include Hindustan, Pakistan, Afghanistan etc (and also any nation-state that doesn’t end in the word “-stan”). However, they do not need to be limited to modern nation-states ran by taxing-authorities (central governments), and instead could refer to **any** community or organisation of people, even those based on voluntary associations on a private (independet/non-state) basis. Examples of this can include housing associations, communes, and even businesses! In its broadest sense, a “Stan”, therefore, is any organisation or community of people who come together, pool resources, acquire territory (and this does not have to be large, or contiguous) to pursue a shared objective. 


## Stanistan In a nutshell

---

- The Stanistan model is a method of organising communities that aims to respect diversity and offer avenues in which people are able to establish their own experiments in Statecraft.
- Instead on one central government that imposes one singular system on all citizens involuntarily, this method decentralises power and offers opportunities to join systems of your choice and/or start your own governments with unique, private constitutions or contracts.
- Each contract specifies the specific arrangements of how exactly the Stan operates, what are the minimum requirements and laws. Some Stans may charge a fee or rent (in place of taxes), or others may find other ways in which to generate income to cover its costs. This is up to the Stan to figure out for themselves and try to reach a balance between human satisfaction and economic viability.
- The “freedom of exit” (upheld by the Azadist Misl System or central government*) ensures that people are not stuck in any one contract when it no longer meets their needs or wants, and are able to move and apply to join another one that can. Since human preferences are diverse, there will similarly arise a wide variety of options to choose from.
- Some people may want to live democratically, whereas others may prefer to live under a monarchy. Some may value a Capitalistic system, others may value a Communistic one. Some may want to live in a Stan focused on education and research, whereas others prefer a Stan focused on leisure or retirement. Some may want to live in big cities, where others may be happy just in small communes. Human beings are not all identical, nor in the same situations and so imposing one system on everyone is foolish. Azadism suggests giving people choices.
- In this way, a Stanistan is establishes a “Market for governance” in which there are many competing offerings, each experimenting with their own ideologies to establish areas that people are willing to participate in.
- If a Stan is able to offer opportunities or a quality of life that is attractive, it will receive positive immigration, bringing with them skills, talents and wealth to grow the project further. If a Stan is poorly planned and can not sustain itself or its resources, then it will not be able to attract participants and any existing ones may leave along with the founders, freeing up resources for others to try something better.
- Failure is a part of progress, and having an environment where failures can happen safely and without collapsing the entire system is essential. The robustness of a Stanistan allows for individuals Stans to experiment, fail, and for the developers to learn lessons and to try again better. The people are protected by the fact that they have ample alternatives to choose from in case one Stan fails.
- If someone feels like they can do a better job, then they simply need to raise funds, purchase some land and try it!
- Depends on time frame. Azadism can be implemented in a variety of ways, but it generally believes that a limited central government model based on a robust constitution (constitutional republic and highly federalist) may be most appropriate in the short-term and in the long-term power can be decentralised further into a modernised Khalsa Misl system as per Azadism’s conception which tweaks it to overcome some of the pitfalls and expand on the successes of the last time the Khalsa was organised as Misls.
