An **Akhara** (or Akhada) is a traditional space for martial, physical, and sometimes spiritual training, historically associated with South Asian warrior cultures. The word "Akhara" originates from Sanskrit, meaning a place for practice or training, often linked to wrestling and physical fitness. Over time, it has evolved to represent broader institutions where individuals engage in rigorous training, discipline, and self-improvement, particularly in martial skills.

In the Sikh tradition, Akharas hold a unique significance as centres for preparing Sikhs in both physical and spiritual domains. Historically, they were spaces where Sikhs trained in martial arts, such as Shastar Vidiya (science of weaponry), and honed their warrior ethos, grounded in the concept of **Miri-Piri** (temporal and spiritual sovereignty). One of the earliest examples we have of an Akhara being set up as a Sikh Space is perhaps the Mal Akhara set up by Guru Angad Dev Ji at Khadur Sahib where Sikhs engaged in wrestling.

In todayâ€™s context, Akharas can be placed as the Sikh Spaces for physical fitness, martial arts, and training related to combat. Modern Akharas can function as:

- Gyms
- Marital Arts Academies
- Shooting ranges
- Gun clubs

Similar to a [Bunga](https://bungaazaadi.com/01-Raajniti-Vidya/Stanistan/Small-Scale-Stans/Sikh-Spaces/05-Bunga/Bunga) , which are centres for learning non-combat related topics, an Akhara is also a very flexible type of space that can be incorporated into other types like a Dharmsaal or a Shastargarh.
