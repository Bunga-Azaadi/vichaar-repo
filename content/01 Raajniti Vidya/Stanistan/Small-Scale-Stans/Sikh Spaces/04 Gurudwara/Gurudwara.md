The following are submissions from Sangat on how they would structure a Gurudwara.

This can also include case studies or “business plans” of existing Gurudwarai. These should essentially be end-to-end guides that other Sangat can follow or adapt to set up their own a Gurudwara on your model — so be detailed!
