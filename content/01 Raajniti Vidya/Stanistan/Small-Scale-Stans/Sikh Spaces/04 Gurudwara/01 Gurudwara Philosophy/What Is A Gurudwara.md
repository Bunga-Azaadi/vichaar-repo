## Definition and Origins

Gurdwara, derived from the Gurmukhi script (ਗੁਰਦੁਆਰਾ), translates to "Guru's portal," "abode," or "house." Historically, before the prevalence of the term "Gurdwara," Sikh places of worship were referred to as "[Dharamsalas](https://coda.io/d/_dzq30-Dy_ZQ/_sui7I)," emphasizing both spiritual practice (Simran) and selfless service (Seva).

## Etymology

Breaking down the term "Gurdwara," it can be seen as a fusion of two components: "Gur" or "Guru," representing the revered Guru Granth Sahib and the divine word (Gurbani/Waheguru/Shabad), and "duwara," signifying "door" or "gateway."


**Accuracy of Spelling and Interpretation**

While conventionally spelled as "Gurdwara" and interpreted as the "House of the Guru," a closer examination reveals potential nuances. In the Gurmukhi script and the scriptures like Sri Guru Granth Sahib or Bhai Gurdas Ji's Vaaran, the term is consistently spelled as "Gur-duara." This suggests a deeper interpretation, where "duara" implies "through" or "by means of." Hence, a more precise definition of "Gurduara" emerges as a pathway facilitated by the Guru, signifying the spiritual journey undertaken by Sikhs with the Guru's guidance.

If today we accept a Gurudwara being a place where the Guru resides, then technically during the times of the human manifestations of the Guru, there would only be one Gurudwara situated wherever the Guru was at the time. Any other formal place where Sangat congregated would have been a Dharamsaal. But then how do we reconcile mentions of “Gurudwara”, or more specifically “Guru Duar” by the Guru in GurBani? Probably the same way a lot of metaphors used by them are hinted at as something internal rather than external.

Understanding it this way puts Shabads like the following into perspective:

---

ਗੁਰ ਦੁਆਰੈ ਹਰਿ ਕੀਰਤਨੁ ਸੁਣੀਐ ॥

At the Gurdwara, the Guru's Gate, the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises are sung.

ਸਤਿਗੁਰੁ ਭੇਟਿ ਹਰਿ ਜਸੁ ਮੁਖਿ ਭਣੀਐ ॥

Meeting with the True Guru, one chants the Lord's Praises.

ਕਲਿ ਕਲੇਸ ਮਿਟਾਏ ਸਤਿਗੁਰੁ ਹਰਿ ਦਰਗਹ ਦੇਵੈ ਮਾਨਾਂ ਹੇ ॥੪॥

The True Guru eradicates sorrow and suffering, and bestows honor in the Court of the Lord. ||4||

— Sri Guru Granth Sahib, Ang 1074

Instead of the bricks and mortar being the defining factor of a “Guruduara”, perhaps instead it is the functionality. This can be detached from any building or physical structure. So instead, wherever Kirtan is performed, that place becomes a portal to the Guru. This could be in a building that Sangat share (like Dharamsaals, or what we call Gurudwarai post-Human Guru times), or your own home, or even your own mind!

ਗੁਰ ਦੁਆਰੈ ਨਾਉ ਪਾਈਐ ਬਿਨੁ ਸਤਿਗੁਰ ਪਲੈ ਨ ਪਾਇ ॥

Through the Guru's Gate, the Gurdwara, the Name is obtained. Without the True Guru, it is not received.

ਸਤਿਗੁਰ ਕੈ ਭਾਣੈ ਮਨਿ ਵਸੈ ਤਾ ਅਹਿਨਿਸਿ ਰਹੈ ਲਿਵ ਲਾਇ ॥੩॥

Through the Pleasure of the True Guru's Will, the Name comes to dwell in the mind, and then, night and day, one remains lovingly absorbed in the Lord. ||3||

  

— Sri Guru Granth Sahib, Ang 1015

## Conclusion:

The term "Gurdwara" transcends its literal meaning to embody the essence of Sikh spirituality and devotion. It symbolizes not only a physical place of worship but also a spiritual gateway through which Sikhs seek enlightenment of Ik and blessings of the Guru. Understanding the nuanced interpretation of "Gurduara" enriches one's appreciation of Sikh culture and faith.


In this Vichaar it was revealed that what we commonly identify as a Gurudwara today has a more spiritual definition that relates to an individuals journey within themselves to achieve a sort of enlightenment and realisation of the presence of the SatGuru, which is present in all. However, as the Sikh community has evolved over time, the term Gurudwara has been utilised beyond this deeper understanding to also refer to a building in which we house Sargun Saroops (physical representations) of the Guru Granth Sahib.

It is not unusual for identical terms to evolve and be used in different ways depending on context. Indeed we see this with the term “Khalsa” for instance too, where it is used by Bhagat Kabir in Sri Guru Granth Sahib, but also then later adopted by Guru Gobind Singh to label the new expression of Sikhi, an order of warrior-saints, that he establishes and also gifts the status of Guru too.

ਪਰਿਓ ਕਾਲੁ ਸਭੈ ਜਗ ਊਪਰ ਮਾਹਿ ਲਿਖੇ ਭ੍ਰਮ ਗਿਆਨੀ ॥  
Death has fallen on the whole world; the doubting religious scholars are also listed on the Register of Death.

  

ਕਹੁ ਕਬੀਰ ਜਨ ਭਏ ਖਾਲਸੇ ਪ੍ਰੇਮ ਭਗਤਿ ਜਿਹ ਜਾਨੀ ॥੪॥੩॥  
Says Kabeer, those humble people become pure - they become Khalsa - who know the Lord's loving devotional worship. ||4||3||

It is the latter conception of the Gurudwara, being an abode of a physical representation the Guru Granth Sahib, that will be referred to in this section of the Vichaar Repo.
