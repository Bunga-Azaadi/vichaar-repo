## A Palace Fit For A King

  

> Imagine a curious non-Sikh who is introduced to Sikhi by an enthusiastic Sikh. The devotee speaks passionately about the Guru, describing them as the "King of Kings," a divine representative, and even a manifestation of God themselves. Intrigued by these grand claims, the seeker eagerly agrees to visit a nearby Gurudwara to experience the Guru's presence firsthand.
> 
> As they approach the temple, the seeker's anticipation builds. They envision a majestic structure befitting the exalted status of the Guru they've heard so much about. However, once there, their excitement quickly turns to confusion as they find themselves standing before an old, converted factory building.
> 
> Stepping inside, the seeker's disappointment deepens. Instead of the expected grandeur, they encounter a space marred by neglect: faulty plumbing, worn-out carpets, faded walls, and unpleasant odors from poorly maintained facilities. The final letdown comes in the Darbar itself, where the Guru Granth Sahib - the living Guru - rests not on a regal throne, but in a palki adorned with plastic and imitation gold.
> 
> This stark contrast between the lofty descriptions of the Guru and the actual state of the Gurudwara leaves the seeker questioning the sincerity of the Sikh community's devotion. It raises an important question: If the Guru is truly revered as the "King of Kings," shouldn't the space dedicated to their honor reflect that divine status?

  

How truly embarrassing. For community who makes so much noise about how amazing the Guru is, you would expect the places where we house Sargun Saroops to be the pinnacle of Sikh excellence. However, since we have prioritised a quantity over quality approach, Gurudwarai have popped up all over the place with no regard to a minimum standard. You have some places with multiple on the same road! They are treated like mere businesses that use the Guru as a prop to raise money with, rather than a palatial building where the community comes together to enthrone the Guru and revere them in a way that befits their status.

  

This lack of quality and aesthetic is present in all aspects of the Gurudwara experience, from the interior design, architecture, to the kirtan which is no longer performed in the traditional, high-class Raag or Gurbani Sangeet method, and instead replaced by bollywood tunes, simplistic instruments and even just screaming in some places.

  

I suggest that if we are going to grant a building the status of a Gurudwara, then it should have extremely high standards. A Gurudwara should not be a makeshift, shoddily refurbished and poorly designed structure, it should be a palatial complex fit for kings. The interior design and architecture should rival and surpass that of other communities, employing the best talent from around the world. The everyday practices should be of the highest quality, performed by skilled professionals hired and paid well for their services.

  

This may mean that to establish a Gurudwara will be a highly resource intensive endeavor — as it rightfully should be. As a result of these high standards, there will likely be far less Gurudwarai, which isn’t wholly undesirable. It would encourage Sikh communities to come together in a central location, uniting their efforts to honor and learn from the Guru. By pooling their resources and working as one, they can create a truly worthy space for the Guru, rather than dispersing into smaller groups and constructing subpar buildings that fall short of the reverence a Gurudwara should embody. This consolidation ensures that each Gurudwara genuinely lives up to its sacred purpose, rather than merely adopting the name without meeting the standards befitting the Guru's presence.

  

## The SAS Standard

  

- Security
- Aesthetic
- Saroop

  

### Security

First priority is ensuring security. If a Gurudwara is not secure, it can not guarantee to the safety of the Sangat and the preservation of a Sargun Saroop of Guru Granth Sahib, then it simply should not have a Saroop. Preventing Beabdi is a top priority, and if a Gurudwara can not ensure this to any reasonable degree via full-time, 24/7 security details, then it should not have a Saroop. If there is no Saroop, then it can not be claimed to be a Gurudwara, and so must be relugated to the status of a [Dharamsaal](https://coda.io/d/_dzq30-Dy_ZQ/_suPIr).

  

### Aesthetic

The second minimum is that it must be beatiful. Now, obviously this is no objective measure, but the aim should be to leave as many people awestruck as possible. It is hard to deny the grandeur of certain cathederals or the intricate geometry of major Mosques. Although, there are many puratan Gurudwarai like Hazur Sahib, Harmandir Sahib etc, that still represent a lot of masterful art of Sikhi, these are not the norm and are targets for destructive “restoration”. A Gurudwara should be a serence space that is a love letter to the Guru by culminating art and craft.

### Sargun Saroop

Only then should you install a Sargun Saroop of the Guru Granth Sahib.

## Cautions

Centralising is risky. If the community can’t come together and determine things like management styles or agree on roadmaps, then they simply won’t have a Gurudwara. Which is desirable, since it prevents the Guru from being hosted in a subpar structure that can’t even guarantee basic things like security, let alone the respect expected for the king of kings. If Sikhs in an area really want a Gurudwara, then they will need to learn how to compromise, respect each other and form professional ways to arbitrate disputes and have debates that do not devolve into nonsense brawls. However, if groups fundamentally disagree, then they can split and experiment with other types of Sikh spaces, without a Sargun Saroop, and expand them in their own right before investing to establishing a Gurudwara of sufficient standard to enthrone the Guru within. This also is not undesirable. If Sikhs compete with each other to establish excellence, then there is a higher chance of achieving it when there are competitors. But the high standards need to be prioritised. Simply and cheaply refurbishing an old factory building and placing a Saroop there is not good enough at all and I personally am getting frustrated at how embarrassing this is.
