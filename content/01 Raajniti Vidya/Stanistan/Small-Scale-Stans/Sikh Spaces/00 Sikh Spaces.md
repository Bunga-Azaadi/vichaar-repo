### About

One opportunity to test statecraft on a small scale is through “Sikh Spaces”. This should provide an avenue in which to build the necessary skills, knowledge and competency to effectively engage in statecraft on larger scales later. If we as a Panth can’t get it right on a small level, then what use is attempting larger level projects in which the consequences would similarly be on a larger scale. However, not all Sikh Spaces have to be Gurudwarai. 

This project is an attempt at outlining various types of Sikh Spaces, and offers a platform for the Sangat interesting in designing and implementing their own Sikh Space to gather knowledge to help them in their endeavour. We also seek to address current pitfalls and reorient how we think about our Sikh Spaces. If you would like to get involved, please get in touch! We are accepting high-quality Vichaars that add to the following sections or sub-sections within this repository. If you have an idea for a Sikh Space, whether it be a particular process or a whole plan on how to build one, then we would love to hear from you and work together to see if your Vichaar is suitable to be hosted here. The aim is to establish a repository of wisdom relating to setting up Sikh Spaces that Sangat from around the world can use as a reference guide or source of inspiration when attempting their own projects. We hope to collect case-studies, business plans, and all sorts of great ideas related to Sikh Spaces!


### Types of Sikh Spaces

- [[Chowni]] — The Most Fundamental Building Block of a Sikh Space
- [[Dharamsaal]] — The Most Common Type of a Sikh Space with Permanent Structures
- [[Shastargarh]] — Houses of Weaponry
- [[Gurudwara]] — The Pinnacle Type of a Sikh Space
- [[Bunga]] — Sikh Spaces Devoted to Knowledge
- [[Akhara]] — Sikh Spaces for Learning the Art of Combat
- [[Takht]] — Sikh “Thrones” - Political Buildings, Embassies or Meeting Places for the Khalsa


Not all of these are strictly seperate spaces from each other either. It is possible to combine and incorporate aspects of multiple spaces into one. For instance, a Shastargarh may also contain an Akhara, or a Bunga may be hosted by a Gurudwara etc.
