Before attempting larger scale experiments in statecraft, such a nation-state, it is important to develop the actual competency required. The concept of “Small Scale Stans” (SSS) we can aim to acquire land and property to conduct smaller scale experiments in statecraft by essentially establishing mini “states within states”. This could be done through a variety of means including buying empty plots of land, private islands, or acquiring existing districts in cities to rejuvenate. 

This will also allow Sikhs to replicate what the Jewish and Qatari communities have done with areas in London for instance where they own property, have their own schools, ambulance services and private police forces! There is nothing stopping us Sikhs from following in the footsteps of our Gurus (who also set up their own town steads and cities) and establishing our own dominions within existing systems as a first step towards greater autonomy, co-dependence and self-reliance.
