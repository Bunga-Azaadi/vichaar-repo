Combining both Sikh principles and Economic theory, the Azadist Manifesto aims to bring these concepts to the attention of the Guru Khalsa Panth and the wider Sangat so that we may form appropriate strategies to establish Khalsa Raaj. This is an attempt at outlining a detailed vision of what Azaadi looks like when applied in reality and its eventual full implication.
