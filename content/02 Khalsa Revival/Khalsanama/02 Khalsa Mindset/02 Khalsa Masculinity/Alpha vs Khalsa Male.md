## “Alpha” Male

Was sent this image of Andrew Tatte and a Singh (wonder who he is?).

  

I find it weird how some people idolise Tate despite his clear immaturity and broken takes. He is popular for his advocacy of the so-called "alpha" male trope. But a lot of that appeals mostly teenagers or adults with seemingly severe insecurities and a gullible nature, easily impressed by showmanship (kind of explains why the same sorts of people become sheep to Dere Babai as well).

  

Tate flaunts his material wealth often at the expense of others and may lecture others about abstaining from vices like pornography, and instead encouraging young men to work hard, “grind” and become successful - which is genuinely a positive message, but it is tainted by the fact that this "Alpha male" himself made money by pretending to be the girls he exploited for live porn videos and messaging with the guys paying to watch and chat with them (but was actually Tate typing everything).

[Criminal Lawyer Legally Analyzes Andrew Tate’s Own Incriminating Words About His Business ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gs5b04hnfMQ&ab_channel=CLRBruceRivers) 

He is perhaps the most famous hypocrite on the planet at the moment, and it is surprising to see Sikhs just blindly follow along with his nonsense. Sure, some of the stuff he says is quite good, but so much other stuff is brain damaging. Most of his "advice" for women are designed for those sorts of low-quality ones who are found in clubs and bars, not respectable women who are meant to be birthing Jodhe and teaching Sikhi to your children. The types of men seeking out the former are equally low-quality.

  

The guy is a [glorified pimp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o68nknCO5sg&ab_channel=JordanBPetersonClips) who taught courses on how to trick young women into taking off their clothes on camera so that he could take all the money. The "Matrix" narrative he cries about these days is just him playing victim and trying to fool people that he is being persecuted for his political views instead of investigations into his bragging on camera about how he would defraud and sexually exploit women. He is fully just a character from Charitaropakhyaan and it would be hilarious (it still kind of is) if it were not for the fact that young, impressionable Sikh males get fooled.

  

There's a weird irony in a Sikh supporting a (now) Muslim from Luton that got rich off grooming.

## Khalsa Male

  

If you're a Sikh and want to pursue masculinity healthily, then abandon this alpha male bs and become a Khalsa male. If you want to be a man then listen to the Guru:

  

---


**ਯਾਂਤੇ ਸਰਬ ਖਾਲਸਾ ਸੁਨੀਅਹਿ । ਆਯੁਧ ਧਰਿਬੇ ਉਤੱਮ ਗੁਨੀਅਹਿ ।**

The Guru then said to his Sikhs, "All of the Khalsa should listen [to this directive], carrying weapons is the highest action.

  
**ਜਬਿ ਹਮਰੇ ਦਰਸ਼ਨ ਕੋ ਆਵਹੁ । ਬਨਿ ਸੁਚੇਤ ਤਨ ਸ਼ਸਤ੍ਰ ਸਜਾਵਹੁ ।।੭।।**

When you come to have my Darshan, adorn your body with weapons.

  
**ਕਮਰ ਕਸਾ ਕਰਿ ਦੇਹੁ ਦਿਖਾਈ । ਹਮਰੀ ਖੁਸ਼ੀ ਹੋਇ ਅਧਿਕਾਈ ।**

When showing yourself to me have your Kamar Kasa [waist band which holds weapons] tied, in such a way I shall be extremely happy.

  
**ਸ਼ਸਤ੍ਰ ਕੇਸ ਬਿਨ ਪਾਉ ਲਖਹੁ ਨਰ । ਕੇਸ ਧਰੇ ਤਬਿ ਆਧੋ ਲਖਿ ਉਰ ।।੮।।**

Those men who do not have Kesh [unshorn hair] or Shastars [weapons], do not recognize those men as full men. Those who have Kesh [unshorn hair], recognize those as half-men.

  
**ਕੇਸ ਸ਼ਸਤ੍ਰ ਜਬਿ ਦੋਨਹੁਂ ਧਾਰੇ । ਤਬਿ ਨਰੁ ਰੂਪ ਹੋਤਿ ਹੈ ਸਾਰੇ ।**

Those who have adorned themselves with Kesh [unshorn hair] and Shastar [weapons], those men have attained their full form."

Stop begging it off slapheads like Tate, and adopt better role models like our Shaheeds and Gurus. If you want to be aware of how women (and men) can really be like and the trickeries they play, then simply read Guru Gobind Singh's Charitaropakhyaan Bani.

  

Guru Gobind Singh in particular is the ultimate Sikh male role model, and Mata Sahib Devan is the greatest role model for Sikh females. Especially given the symbolism of placing sweet patase in the Bata when Khande De Pahaul was first prepared, an ultimate expression of femininity.

  

There are many other people that are far more worthy of your time and attention, even if they are not perfect, or even Sikh! Marcus Aurelius, Plato, Lao Tzu, Machiavelli, Chankya etc. If you use Gurbani as your "measuring stick" you can sift through the dirt and uncover the gold, some having less dirt than others. The same is true for Tate, but there is simply so much more gandh and nonsense it's ridiculous why you would devote the effort when you have so many other better alternatives.

  

We have access to so much ancient wisdom that would have blown the minds of people a hundred years ago who wouldn't believe how easy it is to access such works (especially since a lot of this stuff used to be gatekept by elites). But people still prefer to follow fools and hypocrites who lie to them because they appeal to people's emotions and insecurities, and have perfected the art of propaganda via social media (the number one source of info for so many people).

  

Therefore I believe we should discard this modern attempt at erecting a pseudo-caste system of alpha, beta, sigma or whatever and instead promote our own terminology for a healthy masculinity with the Khalsa male being the peak (as it should be, since the [The Khalsa Is The Guru](https://coda.io/d/_d-P8VwHSBHL/_suc5y)). Especially amongst Sikhs, whenever we hear anyone talking about alpha or whatever, tell them to keep Kesh and Shastar and become Khalsa if they are a "real man", otherwise go be a Tattepanthi somewhere else.

  

As for non-Sikhs, we, the Khalsa should have been in positions where we could have done Parchar on the "Khalsa Male Ideal" to all these young males and given them security and self-confidence via Sikhi and the Khalsa ethos instead. But if we are Ghulam ourselves to stupid mentalities, then how will we spread Khalsa Matt to others?

  

First step to Khalsa Raaj is to become Khalsa, I say this again and again. If we start taking it seriously, then so will the rest of world shortly after.
