Deeper Vichaars related to Sikhi. The outputs in this Vichaar Repository explore Sikh metaphysics, orientation of truths and beliefs, how it relates to other philosophies, the power of Myth, History, symbolism, advocacy for non-literalism and much more. The aim is to combat the often simplistic and watered down version of Sikhi so many of us have been fed.
