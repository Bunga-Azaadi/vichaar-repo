### Intro

In this Vichaar Repository hosted by [Bunga Azaadi](https://www.azadism.co.uk/bunga), we seek to both establish a sort of canon history or lore that the Bunga accepts as its accepted version of events, as well as provide an opportunity for Vicharaks to expand upon with their own research or present disagreements (respectfully). The aim is to collect research on Sikh history so that we as a Bunga can use as a reference point for our other Vichaars, as well as provide Sangat with some information to reach their own conclusions.

As was mentioned in the [introduction to the Azadist Manifesto](https://www.azadism.co.uk/introduction), the “Azadist analytical framework” considers Itihaas as a combination of three things:

- **History** - Events which actually occurred in the past
- **Mythology** - The embellishment and sensationalism of events that may or may not have happened
- **Reality** - How the story is applicable to your own life today

This Vichaar repository in particular is focused primarily on the first component — the actual historical chronology of Sikhi as accurately as we can determine. For more information on Itihaas in general, visit the Itihaasology Vichaar Repository:

However, determining history can be a difficult task. A historian is like a sort of crime scene investigator who do not tend to be present at the time the events occurred, and so must piece together a narrative by collecting evidence to build a case.

Therefore in typical Azadist fashion, we present this Vichaar Repo as a “market place for ideas”, where positions can be presented, tested, debunked and changed when better evidence comes to light. What we hope to do is to iterate the process of researching history so that we can forge some Official Bunga Azaadi Positions (OBAPs) by assessing the Vichaars collected here. But to do this, we need to kickstart the process by setting some initial positions.

With the blessings of the Khalsanama Productions, Bunga Azaadi is honoured to host their documentaries in this Vichaar Repo and use it as a sort of backbone for any further Vichaars that may branch off them over time. This may involve more in depth Vichaars, further research, opinions or even counter-arguments!

Over time, the Bunga will discuss and debate the research collected here and determine OBAPs. These pages will be labeled as such, but critically, it must be understood that an OBAP does not mean that all Bunga members agree, nor that this is the official standard position for the whole Sikh Panth. Similarly, the positions held by KhalsaNama Productions are their own also and should be taken independently.

As mentioned, we also welcome counter-Vichaars as well. If they are presented professionally and respectfully, we would be happy to review and if appropriate host them in this Vichaar Repository. Although they may not receive a OBAP label, they may be included regardless so that Sangat can hear both sides of a topic and make up their own mind.

Sikh History pages/projects in particular are encouraged to contribute — get in touch!
