## Description

This video aims to explore the very early Khalsa via historical sources from both the Mughals and the Sikhs, from the late 17th/early 18th centuries. We also aim to look at the early Khalsa, in the context of Indic and Persianate civilisations, and examine what it's emergence meant for both the Sikhs and the Mughals. We explain the Masaands, historical Sikh splinter groups, the Mughal use of the word Khalsa, the court of Guru Gobind Singh, the Dasam Granth, Khalsa traditions, historical rehitnamei, as well as the moral and spiritual components of the early Khalsa. In the previous episode we talked about the triumph of the Tat Khalsa identity over all other Sikh sects, in the British Raj. At the beginning of the 20th Century, the Khalsa began to be seen as the only legitimate body which presided over all Sikh affairs. This was a period where non-Khalsa Sikhs began to conform to the standards set by the tat-Khalsa. All of the changes during this period produced a synthesis of many different traditions mixed into the Khalsa identity which gives us the flavour of the modern day Khalsa. The modern Khalsa identity owes much to the Singh Sabha movements, as well as the popular influence of the different Jathebandia today (like the AKJ, Damdami Taksal, and Nanaksari). Because the Sikh identity first went through the prism of the Singh Sabha movements in the late 1800s, and then later went through the influence of different post Singh Sabha jathebandhia all throughout the 20th century, we may now be looking at the modern day Khalsa in a completely different light to what the very early Khalsa actually was. We aim to uncover and explore the Khalsa of old in its earliest form, and compare this with notions relating to modern perceptions of the Khalsa. Building up from our previous video, we aim to look at how accurate the various Singh Sabha movements and Jathebandhias were in their efforts to revive the Khalsa of old. We will also explore the role and purpose of the Khalsa in relation to the wider Sikh universe.

**Nirmalas** 
Boundaries were fluid prior to the Singh Sabha movement. The Nirmalas have also been described as Khalsa Sikhs by Giani Gian Singh in the late 1800s. He included the Nirmalas, Nihangs and Kukas as Khalsa Sikhs. Nirmalas would be both sehajdhari and Khalsa Sikhs. The Udasis, however, would be predominantly non-Khalsa, and would not adminster khandei-di-pahul to their sangats. Some Nirmalas would move towards more of a 'Hindu' identity and others 'Sikh' after the Singh Sabha movement. 

**The call for five heads Vaisakhi 1699** 
Other Sikh texts follow with the story of the Jatkha of goats from Koer Singh's 1751 text including Sukha Singh's Gurbilas, Sumer Singh's Gurbilas, and other classical Sikh texts including Giani Gian Singhâ€™s Panth Parkash, Kavi Santhokh Singh's Suraj Parkash and Rattan Singh Bhangu's Panth Parkash. The alternative school of thought is that the Punj Pyarei had their heads physically slit off and then were put back on by Guru Gobind Singh - this appears in a text called â€˜Sri Gur Kathaâ€™ - the language used in this text leaves major early Khalsa scholars feeling this was written much later and not of the time.
