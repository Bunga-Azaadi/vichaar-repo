## Description

Have you ever wondered why there are so many different forms of practicing Sikhi today? Many Jathebandia, sampardas, ideologies, rehit-maryadas, and schools of thought exist and it can be quite difficult to make sense of it all. Where did they all stem from? What are the true origins of the Nihangs, SGPC, Damdami Taksal, Nanaksar, the Akhand Kirtani Jatha and other Sants and Deras? Which strand of Sikh thought most fits your world view?

This episode explores the Sikh landscape of the 18th century, and maps the most significant strands and consequential bodies which existed amongst the Khalsa and the Khulasaa, during the height of Sikh rule.

We will be covering all of the schismatic groups which broke away from Khalsa norms, including the Jit-malias and the Bandai Khalsa. We will also be covering true origins of the early sects including the Akali-Nihangs, Gianis, Guru-lineages (of the Bedis and the Sodhis), Nanakpanthis, Nirmalas, Sevapanthis, Udasis, and Dhirmaliaâ€™s.

Our narrative and exploration of each sect will be interwoven with a newly created map of the Sikh universe, and we will compare modern denominations with historical philosophies and practices.
